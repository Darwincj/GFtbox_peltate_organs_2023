# GFtbox_peltate_organs
This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Diversification of ranunculaceous petals in shape supports a generalized model for plant lateral organ morphogenesis and evolution", by Cheng et al., published in Science Advances, April 2023.

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
